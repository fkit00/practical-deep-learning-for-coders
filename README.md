# practical-deep-learning-for-coders
Hi, this repo is to contain my projects done on the practical deep learning for coders course!

I've been having a very fun time trying to train a model to recognise the difference between Bryce Dallas Howard, Isla Fisher, Amy Adams and Jessica Chaistan, and it has failed terribly - so my next job is to go back and clean the data! 

However, i do have a model that can tell the difference between a cartoon image of mars and a pepperoni pizza so you win some you lose some. 
I've been following the amazing practical deep learning for coders course which can be found here https://course.fast.ai/

Errors to fix - have a think about the sizing - this could be a big thing affecting the error rate and more in depth cleaning of the data. Maybe scalling back comparisons will help. overall error rate is too high but improving
