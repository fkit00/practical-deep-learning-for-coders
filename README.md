# practical-deep-learning-for-coders
Hi, this repo is to contain my projects done on the practical deep learning for coders course!

I've been having a very fun time trying to train a model to recognise the difference between reheaded actresses in hollywood and it has failed terribly - so my next job is to go back and clean the data! 

However, i do have a model that can tell the difference between a cartoon image of mars and a pepperoni pizza so you win some you lose some. 
I've been following the amazing practical deep learning for coders course which can be found here https://course.fast.ai/
